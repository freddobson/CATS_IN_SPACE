Assets folder

Put your static game assets here:

- `sprites/` — image files (PNG, SVG) for ships, enemies, particles
- `sfx/` — short sound effects (OGG/MP3) and music

Suggested filenames:
- `sprites/player.png`, `sprites/enemy_bee.png`, `sprites/enemy_boss.png`
- `sfx/explosion.ogg`, `sfx/shot.ogg`

Keep assets small (8-64 KB) for fast page loads. Add files and reference them from your code via relative paths, e.g. `assets/sprites/player.png`.
